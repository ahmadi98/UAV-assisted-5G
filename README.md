# UAV-assisted-5G

Investigating the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted 5G communications in the form of flying base stations (FBSs). The techniques deployed include assessing, improving, and developing optimization methods to route drones that carry Flying Base Station (FBS) enhancing the terrestrial 5G network infrastructure. One way being effectively collecting and transmitting data through line of sight (LoS) communication to support flash crowds, machine type communication (IoTs), analysis of energy consumption, and total time to complete the tasks.
